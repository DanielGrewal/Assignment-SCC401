Within the assignment folder, there will be an R script and a Java file.

First, run the Java file, no output will be shown to screen, the Java
file produces .csv files to be read by the R script. Then run the R
script by pressing the "Source" button in RStudio. Make sure that you
have a function to overwrite 'setwd()' -- if unsure, speak to Dr Stuart
Sharples. The R script may take several minutes to run, depending on
machine performance, once run, it will generate a workspace of variables
and functions as well as save several plots to files in your working
directory. The R console will show warning messages when being sourced,
these can be ignored.
