Within the assignment folder, there will be an R script and a Java file.
It is preferred if you perform the steps at the bottom of this document to open files.
You will need to download, install and add the opencsv package to your library in eclipse.

First, run the Java file, no output will be shown to screen, the Java
file produces .csv files to be read by the R script. Then run the R
script by pressing the "Source" button in RStudio. Make sure that you
have a function to overwrite 'setwd()' -- if unsure, speak to Dr Stuart
Sharples. The R script may take several minutes to run, depending on
machine performance, once run, it will generate a workspace of variables
and functions as well as save several plots to files in your working
directory. The R console will show warning messages when being sourced,
these can be ignored.
